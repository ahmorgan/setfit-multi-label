Because of this, I feel pretty neutral as nothing has terribly hard outside of a few mishaps with python and git here and there. . Working with Python and using Git were the biggest challenges so far. Getting used to coding in Python has still been a bit of a challenge for me and using git in Pycharm was also an issue at first. But as I am practicing, I feel that I getting better at using both and feel a little more comfortable using them for the rest of the semester. . I continued to use resources like Youtube, Sololearn, GeeksforGeeks, and Stackflow to practice and get a better understanding of coding in python and I used to the TA(s) office hours to get help with using git. .

It's been fun learning about the different aspects of software design and python, git and SQL. the only issue is just not really used to the online setup so finding the right materials in canvas has been a little tough on where to go for certain topics.. My biggest issue was figuring out how git worked as that's something I've heard lots about but never really knew what it did or how it worked and its purpose. So trying to figure out all the vocabulary surrounding git was a little confusing but I believe I've got a good baseline now.. Google was incredibly helpful as it told me how to do specific things and find settings I didn't know where to look. But for git in general helping me figure out how to commit and push certain things the interactive that was listed in Canvas was really helpful. . The only thing I still don't understand fully is the whole purpose of branches and merging of git and why you would or need to. It just seems like if everyone makes a copy how does git keep track of who made the most recent change and how to say hey this is the version you're going to want to work on while doing this thing..

0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,"😊Satisfied. The class so far has been very straightforward and the lectures make the material very understandable and easy to absorb.. My major challenge with the previous modules has definitely been interfacing with GitHub through the terminal in PyCharm, as for some reason it was giving me a lot of trouble during Assignment 1 with connecting to the remote repository.. I was able to overcome the challenge of connecting PyCharm and the local repository to the remote by searching a few solutions online, and found that one solution was to attempt a commit to check if the remote repo was waiting on a commit in order to be linked properly. Oddly enough, this worked, although the problem seemed to stem from the step of renaming the local repo to ""main""/""master"". When it came time for Assignment 2, I was able to circumvent this issue and managed to connect the local and remote repositories with no issues by skipping this step.. Currently getting back into Python has been the biggest challenge, just due to the rust needing to be knocked off and getting back into the swing of things. Thankfully I've managed to do that mostly fine. I am also attempting to remember to submit multiple commits since I usually like to complete and test the project on my local device before pushing it to save time. When it came to Assignment 2, I was able to implement pieces of my Assignment 1 code to complete it very easily, and so I only needed to make the one commit in order to have the entire completed project on Github.
