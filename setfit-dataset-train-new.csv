There have been several times where my group members and I have expressed confusion to each other over what we were supposed to to complete the project.The group project has been very confusing in terms of how we were meant to complete certain portions of the code and the API, and the instructions for the completion of the user manual have been very minimalistic.As a group, we have gone through the previous assignments to garner as much information as we can in order to fill in the gaps, as well as writing and rewriting the code to the point of where it is now fully functional and complete. As for the user manual, we have gone through exterior resources and examples from the internet in terms of how we should structure the manual.Completing the documentation for the group project is currently our last challenge for this course."

Overall, I'm enjoying the course and finding it valuable.My biggest challenge for these past modules was grasping some of the more complex concepts introduced in the course material. While I found the content engaging and interesting, there were certain topics that required a deeper level of understanding and critical thinking. Additionally, managing my time effectively to keep up with the coursework, assignments, and studying was also a challenge. Balancing my academic responsibilities with other commitments and obligations required careful planning and organization.To overcome the challenges I faced with grasping complex concepts and managing my time effectively during the past modules, I took several proactive steps:

*

Seeking Clarification: I actively sought clarification from my instructors and classmates whenever I encountered challenging concepts or topics. Asking questions during lectures, participating in class discussions, and attending office hours helped me gain a deeper understanding of the material.

*

Utilizing Resources: I made use of various resources available to me, such as textbooks, online tutorials, and supplementary materials provided by the course. These resources helped me reinforce my understanding of difficult concepts and provided alternative explanations when needed.

*

Creating a Study Schedule: I developed a structured study schedule to manage my time more effectively. By allocating specific time slots for studying, completing assignments, and reviewing material regularly, I was able to stay on track with my coursework and avoid last-minute cramming.No, I don't have any current challenges in the course."

I discovered this after I was double checking my assignment post my initial submission, and it definitely caused me some frustration trying to figure it out, as my project would simply not display any of the other categories.I was able to finally overcome this challenge after some effort thanks to some guidance a fellow group member gave me in loading the project via terminal rather than directly through Pycharm. As it turned out, the Pycharm terminal was loading an old version of the project before I had made any changes, but using the base command prompt of my computer showed the changes I had made were working properly.Currently my main challenge I foresee is having to overcome the fact I am due for a major surgery tomorrow morning, and I hope that I will be able to recover quickly so that I may help my group members and keep up with classwork as well."

----------------------

1. Initial Learning:

* I read FastAPI’s official tutorial and followed it to set up a basic FastAPI application.

* I watched introductory videos on FastAPI on YouTube to get a visual understanding of the concepts.

2. Setting Up and Experimenting:

* I set up a virtual environment and installed FastAPI and Uvicorn.

* I created a simple FastAPI app to understand the basics of request handling and routing.

3. Implementing CRUD Operations:

* I followed FastAPI’s tutorial on SQL (Relational) Databases to understand how to work with databases.

* I created models, schemas, and CRUD utility functions in small, incremental steps, ensuring each part worked before moving on to the next.

4. Testing and Debugging:

* I used pytest and httpx to write tests for the CRUD operations.

* I debugged issues by reading error messages carefully and using print statements or logging to understand the flow of data.

5. Building Confidence:

* I created a small project, like a to-do list or a simple blog, to practice CRUD operations in a real-world scenario.

* I gradually added more features, such as authentication, validation, and error handling, to build a more complete application.

6. Continuous Learning:

* I regularly revisited the FastAPI documentation and other resources as new questions and challenges arose.

* I participated in community discussions and sought advice from more experienced developers.Yes I have any currently one challenge in the course.

Challenge: Deploying my FastAPI applications and ensuring they are scalable is an area I'm still trying to master. Understanding how to configure and optimize deployment environments is complex."

I also feel like I would have done better in an in person class especially because I find some of the instructions a little confusing. My biggest challenges were trying to create a database (assignment 3). I could not figure out how to open the workbench and then from there make a database and query it. I also had trouble with the Fast API assignment, for some reason the server was not loading correctly so I was not able to submit in time. I went to office hours for help on both of these assignments but it did not really do much, I also used YouTube as a resource and that helped a little with the questions I had about MySQL. I do not have any challenges I can think of right now, I am just focusing on completing the remaining assignments and participating with my group. "

However, I'm feeling anxious because I think the assignments are getting a bit confusing to understand.My biggest challenge would be understanding and applying the concepts that I've learned in the assignments. I overcame them by using the resources that were provided to me in the modules and by watching a lot of YouTube tutorial videos.No I don't have any current challenges"
0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,"🙂 SatisfiedI am satisfied because the course provides a strong foundation in problem-solving, project management, and coding. The hands-on projects and the group work make the process more practical.My biggest challenge was the first group activity because we had to work together on completing it with people I never met. I overcame this challenge by communicating effectively with my group to finish the activity as a group.The only current challenge is getting better in web dev languages like Javascript, HTML, and CSS."

The questions were a lot tougher than I expected and I did a lot worse than I thought I would. I plan to work hard on Assignment 5 and the Final Project in order to maintain an A average.I didn't necessarily overcome the challenges. I will just make sure to work harder on upcoming assignments.Not necessarily. A little difficulty with FastAPI but nothing I can't handle."
0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,"🙂 SatisfiedSo far i've learned a fair bit about software engineering, though i feel like there should be more content to this course. But since this is a summer course, im sure there are constraints to the amount of content allowed. I haven't had much issues with the past few modules. Other than not getting 100% on some of the quizzes. I should probably review a bit more.No challenges as of now."

I didn't know we even offered other languages. Btw software development is my minor, I'm a math major. No challenges! I genuinely had no challenges! I enjoyed learning MySQL Only challenge is making sure I wrote the correct date down for assignments!"

 My biggest challenge for these past modules are working on the assignment 1 sandwich maker, assignment 2 modular sandwich maker and assignment 3 sandwich maker database by using MySQL to create database and using PyCharm and GitHub to complete the assignments.I overcame this challenge by rereading the assignment directions and following over the rubric and making sure i am completing all the requirements that are listed in the rubric carefully.Currently i don't have any current challenges in the course."
